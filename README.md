## Live Deployment

This application is fully deployed and accessible online:

* **Frontend (Portfolio Website):** <https://www.betancourtosmar.com/>
    * *(Note: The apex domain `betancourtosmar.com` should redirect to `www.betancourtosmar.com`.)*
* **Backend (API):** Available at its designated API endpoint.
    * *(You can access the browsable API at `/api/projects/` or `/api/chat/`.)*

## Architecture

The project follows a modern decoupled architecture:

* **Frontend:** A dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) built with **React** and **Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It consumes data from the backend API.
* **Backend:** A robust API built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. It manages project data, handles user-uploaded media files, and integrates with multiple AI models.
* **Database:** **PostgreSQL** for persistent data storage.
* **Persistent Storage:** User-uploaded media files (like project images) are stored on a **Render Persistent Disk** for durability.
* **Containerization:** Both frontend and backend services are containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated locally with **Docker Compose**.
* **Deployment:** All services are deployed on **Render**, leveraging its capabilities for web services, databases, and persistent disks.
* **AI Integration:**
  * **Text & Code Chatbot:** Powered by **Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3** and **Google Gemini API** for dynamic text and code generation.
  * **Image Generation:** Generate images from text prompts using generative AI models.
  * **Custom AI Models:** Integrates with Hugging Face for fine-tuned models and custom codegen.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
* **Project Showcase:** Dynamically loads and displays portfolio projects with images, descriptions, and links.
* **Experience & Certifications:** Dedicated sections highlighting professional experience and academic achievements.
* **Contact Information:** Easy ways to get in touch.
* **Interactive AI Chatbot:** Live chatbot powered by Mistral-7B v0.3 and Google Gemini, supporting both text and code queries.
* **Code Generation:** Generate code snippets and get coding help via conversational AI.
* **Image Generation:** Create images from text prompts using generative AI.
* **Secure API:** Project management API endpoints are secured, allowing only authenticated users (via Django admin) to create, update, or delete projects.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

To run this project locally using Docker Compose, ensure you have Docker Desktop installed and running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/osmarbetancourt/betancourt-osmar-portfolio.git
    cd betancourt-osmar-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Create `.env` file for Backend:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the `betancourt-osmar-portfolio/` directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located). **Do NOT commit this file to Git.**
    (See above for required variables.)

3.  **Create `.env.local` file for Frontend:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` inside the `frontend/` directory. **Add `/.env.local` to `frontend/.gitignore`.**
    (See above for required variables.)

4.  **Build and Run Docker Containers:**
    ```bash
    docker compose build
    docker compose up --force-recreate
    ```

5.  **Apply Migrations and Create Superuser (Backend):**
    Open a **new terminal** in the project root (while `docker compose up` is running) and execute:
    ```bash
    docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
    docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create your admin user.

6.  **Access the Applications Locally:**
    * **Frontend:** `http://localhost:5173/`
    * **Backend API:** `http://localhost:8000/api/projects/`
    * **Django Admin:** `http://localhost:8000/admin/`

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Render. The deployment process involves:

* **Backend Service:** A Python web service running Django, connected to a Render PostgreSQL database and a **Persistent Disk** for media file storage.
* **Frontend Service:** A Node.js web service running the React application.
* **Custom Domains:** Configured to use `www.betancourtosmar.com` for the frontend. SSL certificates are automatically managed by Render.

## Content Management

* Log in to the Django Admin at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` using your superuser credentials to add, edit, or delete portfolio projects. Images uploaded here will be stored persistently.

## Troubleshooting Local Development

If you still encounter the "Protocol 'http:' not supported. Expected 'https:'" error locally, despite `VITE_APP_BACKEND_URL` being `http://web:8000`, it might indicate a deeper Node.js/Vite proxy issue with protocol handling. As a temporary workaround for local development, you could try explicitly setting `secure: false` and removing the `https` agent logic from `vite.config.js` when `mode === 'development'`, but this is usually not necessary. Ensure all Docker containers are fully rebuilt and recreated.
